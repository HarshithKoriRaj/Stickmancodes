Stickman Codes is an interactive learning platform where two learners join a shared room, talk over live video, and draw in the air using MediaPipe hand tracking. A real-time AI voice agent lets users ask questions verbally and receive instant spoken guidance, like a personal tutor. The platform syncs drawings, gestures, and interactions through PeerJS for seamless collaboration. It also includes 10 levels of gamified learning—such as Caveman Run, Extinguish the Fire, and Bridge Cross—that visually teach core programming logic. Altogether, Stickman Codes transforms coding education into a playful, hands-on, and highly intuitive experience.
